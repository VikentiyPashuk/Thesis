# Principal Component Spectra Analysis Honours Thesis

## Overview

This repository contains code and data for a study exploring the potential of biochar for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, specifically focused on applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectra with a possible extension to CO₂ adsorption. Biochar, known for its porous structure and functional groups, shows promise in this regard.

## Abstract

Biochar, recognized for its porous structure and functional groups, holds promise as a tool for mitigating greenhouse gas transmissions, particularly CO₂. This study acts as a precursor for future exploration of the efficacy of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on Fourier Transform Infrared spectra for sample categorization for CO₂ adsorption. Utilizing RStudio, spectra from feedstock and biochar auger wood and snow crab samples were subjected to PCA. Results indicate that, in smaller sample systems, overall spectral intensity outweighs chemical differences in peak structure, while larger systems exhibit increased significance of peak structure due to comparable intensities. Future research should investigate the influence of experimental conditions, such as temperature and exposure time, on spectral intensity for conclusive PCA clustering. Although PCA effectively distinguishes spectral features in diverse samples, its applicability to larger systems with colinear features requires further exploration.

## Thesis

If needed the thesis is in the repostory under the name `Vikentiy Pashuk Honours Thesis.pdf`

## Usage

- Original code should be executed in RStudio.
- Users can modify the Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) data by providing additional CSV files containing wavenumber and intensity information.

## Visualization

- Refer to `Plots.ipynb` for plotting regimes, modify based on your results and wants.
